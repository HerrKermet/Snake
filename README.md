## Purpose:
The purpose of this repo is to test and evaluate the embedded feature annotations plugin
[HAnS](https://bitbucket.org/easelab/hans-text/src) for IntelliJ.

### The Snake

A simple snake game in java, forked from [@hexadeciman](https://github.com/hexadeciman/Snake).
Using Threads and Java Swing to display the game.
The code is well commented, if you have any questions or want to continue this project feel free to do so ðŸ‘Œ

### How it looks:

#### Requirements:
* IntelliJ installed
* Recommended JDK 14
* Installed HAnS-text plugin

### Tasks:
* Implement and annotate a feature that adds a red poison tile that if eaten shrinks the snake by three tiles. 
  If the snake is less than or equal to three in length, the snake dies. Hint: The poison would follow similar
  implementation as the food feature.
* Rename the "Head" feature to "Positions".
* Inspect the .feature-model and .feature-to-file files.
* After the above tasks are completed, answer the questions [here](https://forms.gle/xWZdGAT9wo6xygov7).
